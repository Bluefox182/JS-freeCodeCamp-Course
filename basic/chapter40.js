// Modify Array Data With Indexes

// Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed free

// Example
var ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15;
// ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].

/*
Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, 
like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, 
this may confuse other programmers reading your code. */

// Example #2
var myArray = [18, 64, 99];
// We modified index 0 to value 45
myArray[0] = 45;
